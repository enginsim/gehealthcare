🌍 Global Business Risk Dashboard   
Project Overview    
This project is being developed by Group 5 in collaboration with GE Healthcare to build a dynamic, real time Country Risk Dashboard.

The dashboard aims to consolidate fragmented country level financial risk data, including macroeconomic indicators, sovereign credit ratings, and real world payment behaviour, into a single, intuitive platform.

By improving risk visibility, the dashboard will support credit risk analysts and decision makers in making faster, more informed international business decisions.

Tableau (for dashboard creation and visualisation)
